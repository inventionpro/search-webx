      <li>Meaningful titles: not one letter or nothing, they should be at least 6 letters.</li>
      <li>Meaningful descriptions: it should have a description, the longer the better, but not too much, less than 100 letters.</li>
      <li>Some text: Having a bit of text on the site might bump it up, but not much.</li>
      <li>Color: Include a theme color, this gives a very very small bump, but still something.</li>
      <li>Favicon: Include a favicon (the image on the tab), this gives a bit more of a bump.</li>
      <li>Quality: Make a good website, we review all websites and give ⭐ and ✔️ to those we like.</li>
